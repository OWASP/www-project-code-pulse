### Road Map and Getting Involved

The initial version of Code Pulse, version 1.0, was released in early May 2014. Since then, we've pushed out multiple versions to address some usability issues and to include support for Java 11, .NET Framework applications, an OWASP Dependency Check integration, and code coverage details at the source code level.

Long-term there are a number of things on our roadmap that we’d like to add to Code Pulse. The following is a partial list of features we’d like to add to Code Pulse as we continue development on it:

- Web request filter

- Performance improvements

Involvement in the development and promotion of Code Pulse is actively encouraged!

You do not have to be a security expert in order to contribute.

Some of the ways you can help:
* Code contributions
* Testing
* Wiki documentation
* Spreading the word about the project!

Visit the [Code Pulse GitHub project page](https://github.com/codedx/codepulse) to see the source.
